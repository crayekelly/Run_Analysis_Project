Features:
	't-' denotes time captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz

	'f-' denotes frequency domain, after Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

	'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

	mean(): Mean value

	std(): Standard deviation

	meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

	'-Acc-': measured by accelerometer

	'-Gyro-': measured by gyroscope

	'-Jerk-' : body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals

	'-Mag-': magnitude of signals calculated using the Euclidean norm

	'angle-': vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample
